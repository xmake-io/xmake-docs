[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)is a commonly used text editor, and xmake provides plug-ins' support.

## Plugin installation

Since VSCode itself only provides text editing functions, we need to install plug-ins to support configuration, compilation, debugging, intellisenses and other functions:

* XMake
* C/C++
* CodeLLDB

After completing the installation of the plug-in, restart VSCode to see the status bar below:

You can set the platform, architecture, compilation mode, tool-chain and other options in the status bar, and then click Build to start the build.

## Custom options

If these options are not enough, you can create .vscode/settings.json and write the settings required by xmake, such as:

```
{
...
  "xmake.additionalConfigArguments": [
    "--my_option=true"
  ],
...
}
```

Other xmake options can also be setted in settings.json. After modification, the configuration can be refreshed through the >XMake: Configure command.

## Improve the development experience with LSP

For a better C++ intellisense experience, xmake provides support for [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP for short). In vscode, you can use the >XMake: UpdateIntellisense command to generate .vscode/compile_commands.json (usually when modifying xmake.lua, this file will be generated automatically). At the same time, we can choose to install a intellisense plug-in that supports LSP, such as [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/) published by LLVM, which is stable and efficient, and support different tool-chain through the LSP standard.

When using clangd, there may be conflicts with the C/C++ plug-in, you can add settings in .vscode/settings.json: 

```
{
  "C_Cpp.codeAnalysis.runAutomatically": false,
  "C_Cpp.intelliSenseEngine": "Disabled",
  "C_Cpp.formatting": "Disabled",
  "C_Cpp.autoAddFileAssociations": false,
  "C_Cpp.autocompleteAddParentheses": false,
  "C_Cpp.autocomplete": "Disabled",
  "C_Cpp.errorSquiggles": "Disabled",
...
}
```

Also, since the compile_commands.json generated by XMake is in the .vscode directory, you need to set the clangd parameter to look for it in the correct location: 

```
{
  "clangd.arguments": [
    "--compile-commands-dir=.vscode",
...
  ]
...
}
```

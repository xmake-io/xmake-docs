Welcome! This is the curated Ideas List for the [Xmake Project](https://xmake.io) and related repositories for Google Summer of Code 2026. Each idea below outlines a meaningful project for contributors. For any questions or clarifications, please join our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/xmake) or open a discussion!


## 1. Create and Package Libraries for [`xmake-io/xmake-repo`](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-repo)

**Goal:**  
Research, create, and contribute new packages (libraries, tools, or headers) to the community-oriented [xmake-repo](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-repo) package repository. Tasks include **writing package scripts, testing/fixing build scripts on various platforms, and documenting usage** to help the Xmake ecosystem.

**Skills Required:** Basic cross-platform C/C++ development, build systems, Lua scripting.


## 2. Support for Building C#/.NET Projects  
Related Issue: [xmake-io/xmake#6057](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake/issues/6057)

**Goal:**  
Extend Xmake to natively support building C#/.NET projects on Windows ([proposal discussion](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake/issues/6057)). This will enable Xmake users to directly describe, configure, and build `.NET`-based solutions and libraries, without depending on external scripts.

**Skills Required:** Familiarity with build systems, basic C#/.NET development, Lua, cross-platform toolchains.


## 3. Zig Package Management and Integration  
Related Issue: [xmake-io/xmake#4348](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake/issues/4348)

**Goal:**  
Add support in Xmake for Zig's package management and fetching ([zig fetch](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake/issues/4348)). Implement tools, modules, or integrations so that `zig` packages can be easily declared, fetched, and built from within Xmake projects.

**Skills Required:** Interest in the Zig language and tooling, Lua scripting, build systems.


## Application Process

Interested contributors should review these ideas, discuss possible approaches with mentors, and make a draft proposal before the GSoC deadline. For general Xmake GSoC logistics, visit: [https://xmake.io](https://xmake.io)

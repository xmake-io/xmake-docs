title: xmake v2.3.6 released, Added fortran compilation support
tags: [xmake, lua, C/C++, toolchains, fortran, zig, golang, dlang]
date: 2020-07-28
author: Ruki
---

This version focuses on some improvements to the support of other languages, such as fortran compilation support, experimental support for zig language, and third-party dependency package support and cross-compilation support for golang/dlang.

Although, xmake focuses on c/c++ build support, other languages support xmake will also make some improvements from time to time. Its main purpose is not to replace their official build system, but only to support mixed compilation with c/c++ , To better serve c/c++ projects,
After all, some c/c++ projects still occasionally call code interfaces of other languages, such as mixed calls with languages such as cuda, dlang, objc, swift, asm, etc., so xmake still provides some basic compilation support for them.

In addition, regarding c/c++, we also support the header file dependency format of the new `/sourceDependencies xxx.json` output in the vs preview version (this is more reliable and stable for multi-language header file dependency detection).

## Introduction of New Features

### Fortran language compilation support

Starting from this version, we have fully supported the use of the gfortran compiler to compile fortran projects, we can quickly create an empty project based on fortran by using the following command:

```console
$ xmake create -l fortran -t console test
```

Its xmake.lua content is as follows:

```lua
add_rules("mode.debug", "mode.release")

target("test")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_files("src/*.f90")
```

More code examples can be viewed here: [Fortran Examples](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake/tree/master/tests/projects/fortran)








### Zig language experimental support

Note: At present, this language xmake is still in the experimental support stage, and it is not perfect. For example, it is not supported on windows, and dynamic library compilation under linux/macOS is not yet supported. Please evaluate and use it yourself.

We can use the following configuration method to try and experience, at least the console and static library programs under linux/macOS can still run.

```lua
add_rules("mode.debug", "mode.release")

target("test")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_files("src/*.zig")
```

As for why windows does not support it, please refer to the issues I mentioned to zig earlier, [#5825](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/5825)

The dynamic library does not support it because I have some pitfalls (the dynamic library generated by zig will automatically append `.0.0.0`), see: [issue 5827](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/ issues/5827)

In addition, I lay down in other pits. I personally feel that there are a lot of pits, so I'm still in the experimental stage for the time being, and I will look at it later.

For more examples, see: [Zig Examples](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake/tree/master/tests/projects/zig)

### Go dependency package and cross compilation support

The new version of xmake continues to make some improvements to the go build support, such as cross-compilation of go. For example, we can compile windows programs on macOS and linux:

```console
$ xmake f -p windows -a x86
```

In addition, the new version also initially supports the third-party dependency package management of go:

```lua
add_rules("mode.debug", "mode.release")

add_requires("go::github.com/sirupsen/logrus", {alias = "logrus"})
add_requires("go::golang.org/x/sys/internal/unsafeheader", {alias = "unsafeheader"})
if is_plat("windows") then
    add_requires("go::golang.org/x/sys/windows", {alias = "syshost"})
else
    add_requires("go::golang.org/x/sys/unix", {alias = "syshost"})
end

target("test")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_files("src/*.go")
    add_packages("logrus", "syshost", "unsafeheader")
```

However, there are still some imperfections. For example, all cascading dependency packages must be manually configured at present, which will be a bit more cumbersome and needs to be improved in the future.

For more examples, see: [Go Examples](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake/tree/master/tests/projects/go)

### Dlang/Dub dependency package support

xmake also supports dlang's dub package management, which can quickly integrate dlang's third-party dependency packages:

```lua
add_rules("mode.debug", "mode.release")

add_requires("dub::log 0.4.3", {alias = "log"})
add_requires("dub::dateparser", {alias = "dateparser"})
add_requires("dub::emsi_containers", {alias = "emsi_containers"})
add_requires("dub::stdx-allocator", {alias = "stdx-allocator"})
add_requires("dub::mir-core", {alias = "mir-core"})

target("test")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_files("src/*.d")
    add_packages("log", "dateparser", "emsi_containers", "stdx-allocator", "mir-core")
```

### cl.exe new header file dependent file support

The header file dependency of msvc usually needs to parse the output content of `/showIncludes` and extract the includes file list inside to handle the dependency compilation problem. However, cl.exe does a very bad job of this output. The includes information and compilation output are Mixed together.

It is very unfriendly to build tools to handle dependency analysis, especially in a multi-language environment, how to judge is includes, you need to judge the extraction through the preceding `Note: including file:` string, but in Chinese, it is `Note: include File: `,
If you change to the Japanese environment, it is also a Japanese prefix string, the encoding format problems, hard-coding problems, and the parsing and processing are not perfect.

Regarding this point, in the latest vs2019 preview version, Microsoft has finally made improvements to the alignment. Through the new `/sourceDependencies xxx.json` compilation option, the includes dependency information can be better output, which is convenient for analysis and extraction in a multilingual environment.

In addition, the output of this new option is independent of a separate json file, and finally is not mixed with the compilation output, and finally there is no need to parse and separate compilation errors, warning messages, and includes list information.

The output will look like this:

```
{
    "Version": "1.0",
    "Data": {
        "Source": "z:\\personal\\tbox\\src\\tbox\\tbox.c",
        "Includes": [
            "z:\\personal\\tbox\\src\\tbox\\tbox.h",
            "z:\\personal\\tbox\\src\\tbox\\prefix.h",
            "z:\\personal\\tbox\\src\\tbox\\prefix\\prefix.h",
            "z:\\personal\\tbox\\src\\tbox\\prefix\\config.h",
            "z:\\personal\\tbox\\src\\tbox\\config.h",
            ...
```

In the new version, xmake handles json parsing by adding a builtin `core.base.json` module, which can easily analyze and support the new header file dependent data. This mode is preferred (if cl is supported by the new version) , The old version of cl still uses `/showIncludes`).

### Xcode plugin generation support

At present, we have no time to implement the generation of xcode projects by ourselves, but it does not mean that it is not supported, because xmake supports the generation of cmakelists.txt files, and cmake supports the generation of xcode project files. Before the official implementation,
We can also support it in disguise through cmake, xmake will automatically call cmake internally to transfer the generated results, there is no difference in use for users, just make sure that cmake is installed:

```console
$ xmake project -k xcode
```

!> After we have time, we will re-implement each more complete xcode output plugin by ourselves, and welcome everyone to contribute.

### Support intellisense for xmake-vscode plugin

Recently, we also updated the [xmake-vscode](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-vscode) plugin, by automatically generating `compile_commands.json` to the current project’s `.vscode` directory, Then we only need to configure `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` and associate this `.vscode/compile_commands.json` path in it
Can realize intellisense automatic prompt, synchronize the configuration information such as includedirs in xmake.lua.

As for how to generate `c_cpp_properties`, there are detailed instructions in the official document: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/configure-intellisense-crosscompilation

The main configuration items inside:

```
  "configurations": [
    {
      "compileCommands": ".vscode/compile_commands.json",
    }
  ],
```

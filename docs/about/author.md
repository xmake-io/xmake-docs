# About the Author

Hello, I am Ruki Wang, the creator and core maintainer of the [Xmake](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake) project.

Beyond developing the Xmake build utility itself, I also maintain the vast majority of projects within the Xmake ecosystem. This includes the official package repository [xmake-repo](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-repo), major IDE plugins ([xmake-idea](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-idea), [xmake-vscode](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-vscode)), as well as auxiliary tools like [xmake-gradle](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-gradle) and [xmake.sh](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake.sh).

Xmake is a completely community-driven open-source project, developed and maintained primarily in my spare time. If Xmake has made your development process easier, saved you time, or improved your efficiency, please consider supporting my work through sponsorship. Your support is the greatest motivation for me to continue improving Xmake and advancing its ecosystem!
